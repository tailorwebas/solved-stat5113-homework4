All of the following problems refer to the “Armadillo kills” data discussed in class. The data are summarized in the table below for your convenience.

<table width="100">

  <tr>

   <td width="45">Kills</td>

   <td width="55">Count</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="45">0</td>

   <td width="55">29</td>

Use a P<em>oi</em>(<em>λ</em>) distribution to model the data, with <em>λ </em>being the unknown “kill rate.”

<ol>

 <li><strong>One or more of the following problems </strong><em>might </em><strong>be graded.</strong></li>

 <li>Estimate the kill rate using the method of Maximum Likelihood.</li>

 <li>Estimate the standard error of the estimator in question 1 using Maximum Likelihood asymptotics.</li>

 <li>Estimate the standard error of the estimator in question 1 using the Bootstrap.</li>

 <li>Estimate the probability of at least one kill using the method of Maximum Likelihood.</li>

 <li>Estimate the standard error of the estimator in question 4 using the delta method.</li>

 <li>Estimate the standard error of the estimator in question 4 using the Bootstrap.B. <strong>The following problem </strong><em>will </em><strong>be graded.</strong></li>

 <li>Compute Bayes estimate of the probability of at least one kill. Take the prior distribution to beG<em>am</em>(<em>α</em><sub>0</sub><em>,β</em><sub>0</sub>), with <em>β</em><sub>0 </sub>= 1<em>.</em>1 and <em>α</em><sub>0 </sub>chosen so that the prior mean of <em>λ </em>is 0.25. Provide also a 95% Credible Interval for the probability of at least one kill.</li>

 <li>What would have been your answer to question 1 be, had the data consisted of 38 zeros? Comparewith the Bayesian answer and comment.</li>
